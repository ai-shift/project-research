* Field research
** Lead processing and service categorization

*** Description

The system analyzes the incoming information using natural language processing to identify key elements such as:
- The type of legal assistance needed
- Case urgency and complexity
- Potential value of the case
- Client's location and jurisdiction
- Any deadlines or time-sensitive matters
 
*** Solution

1. Aggregate different possible inputs (raw text, web form, audio and etc.)
2. Provide it in the unified way to the distilled LLM prompt
3. Gather extracted features

*** Business value

- Minimized lead response time
- Consistent categorization

** Consulatation direction system

*** Description

Intelligently route leads based on the data from [[*Lead processing and service categorization][Lead processing and service categorization]] results
- Consultation type (category -> payed or free)
- Availability of appropriate consultation slots
- Schedule meeting based on the time zone of the client's location, his calendar or preferencesa

*** Solution

TBD

*** Business value

- Minimized time of onboarding
- Reduced scheduling conflicts

** Lawyer allocation system

*** Description

Match cases with appropriate lawyers based on expertise, workload, and availability.
- Tracks current workload

- Clean workers performance metrics

** Reminder system

*** Description

Utility based service which helps to notify any kind of events or urgent situations

*** Solution

Could be implemented as a messsanger bot or dedicated simple app

*** Business value

- Centralized way of fast messages delivery across the company

** Contract automation

*** Description

Streamline contract generation and management processes.
- Template selection based on the case
- Electronic signature integration
